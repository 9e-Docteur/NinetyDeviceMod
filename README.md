### **Important information**
***

* We are still in a update state, we are updating code from 1.12 to 1.19 and so, you can have a lot of error in the code. And so you can't run the game.
* An API will be out for dev to code their own app ;)

***
### **Liscence**
***

The original mod was under GPL3, MrCrayfish wanted that all modified version using the code and assets use also GPL3, so we are also using GPL3.
Feel free to copy part of the code but please credit MrCrayfish and DocTeam (9e_Docteur, PandaRebel, Killar.exe)
